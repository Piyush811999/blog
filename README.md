## Run it yourself

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                          | Action                                                        |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`                    | Installs dependencies                                         |
| `npm run astro dev`              | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`                   |

## ToDo
- [ ] Dark Mode support (It's present in parent [blahg](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg), but I broke it while making modifications)
- [ ] A gallery page for all my Drawings, designs and photography stuff.
- [ ] Links that referece something withing the blog should be of different color to those which reference something external
