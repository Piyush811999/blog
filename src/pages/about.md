# About me

Hi! I’m Piyush Makwana, a Software Engineer currently working at Paytm in Bangalore. I graduated from IIT Roorkee with a B.Tech. in Computer Science & Engineering in 2021. I was born and raised in Ajmer.

I love technology and creating stuff with its help. I like drawing, designing, writing, thinking, playing video games, and recently, I’ve been enjoying watching movies in theaters and playing board games with my friends.
