## Day-1
### Food
* Breakfast: [Café Niloufer Premium Lounge - Banjara Hills](https://maps.app.goo.gl/daKm3prdpXQDG3RM6)
	* **Bun Maska**: Weirdly, they put sugar in the maska, which was not up to my taste. (5/10)
	* **Special Tea**: Very good on its own, and it makes bun maska bearable. (9/10)
* Lunch: [Bawarchi Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xXaghrDLUXKW21BG8)
	* **Chicken Biryani**: The taste was alright, but the ambiance of this place was a big turnoff. The place is always packed, so we had to share tables with a stranger. Overall, it wasn't worth the hype.
* Dinner: [Olive Bistro & Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/13cLcbSTUzCaPZHG8)
	* Good ambiance, although it was too expensive, and the food wasn't that special. (6/10)
* [TRUE BLACK specialty coffee | Jubilee Hills](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MoeaqmCrz5wzsFucA)
	* **Strawberry Latte**: Basically, an overpriced strawberry milkshake where you have to stir the pulp and milk yourself. (5/10)

### Attractions
* [Hussain Sagar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/581DdDNN5vxYobjh7) Maybe it was the afternoon weather, but roaming around this lake was a very lame experience. 
* [Prasads Multiplex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V9HmvkEudWNszsYBA) Very impressive multiplex, with lots of screens, great seating, and screen size. Unfortunately, we saw [The Monkey](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27714946/) there, which was a shitty movie. We had a great nap though.  

## Day-2
### Food 
* Breakfast: [Karachi Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gK5q5TfwSuj615dd8)
	* **Bun Maska**: Much better than the Nilofer one; thankfully, they didn't put sugar in it. (8/10)
	* **Tea**: Ok Ok. (6/10)
* Lunch: [Hotel Shadab](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h4ZfZ8aon9AQmQaT9)
	* **Shadab Special Chicken Biryani**: The overall experience of this place was much better than Bawarchi; they had proper seating arrangements with air conditioning, although it wasn't anything my tongue would remember. (7/10)
* Snacks
	* **Haleem** from [Pista House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8vCEjXKktnNckwoGA): This was the first time I tried haleem; it was rich and flavorful, although it was too heavy to enjoy after a couple of spoons. (7/10)
	* **Matka Special Malai** from [Milan Juice Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/atDFmD1wovNTJDv96): Perhaps the best things I had during this trip; it’s a fresh and flavorful fruit cream dessert. **(9/10)**
* [TRUE BLACK specialty coffee | Jubilee Hills](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MoeaqmCrz5wzsFucA) Visited this place again since we had time to kill before our flight; had their **cold coffee**, which was a disappointment. 

### Attractions
* [Golconda Fort](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8VCj3D29cwS1tKdF6) Pretty decent fort; had fun discovering all the small and hidden passages. Also has a decent city view from the top. (7/10)
* [Salar Jung Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/28Ye8qRAuz1Ei1yj7) Definitely the most interesting attraction of the whole trip. The museum was pretty big and would require 3+ hrs to explore it properly. It had a very wide variety of artifacts from different Indian and foreign cultures.  **(9/10)**
* [Charminar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LN91KAhVqRL2D94e6) is crowded but pretty cool, especially the walk up to the mosque. **(8/10)**

# Review
I visited Hyderabad mainly for food, and in food, mainly biryani. Unfortunately, I didn't find the taste to be worth the trip. On top of this, the popular spots such as Nilofur Cafe and Bawarchi Restaurant are always very crowded. All the attractions mentioned above were fun experiences, but nothing I would like to visit again anytime soon.
