## Highlights
- [Andharban (The Dark Forest)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gn6ayXpvS4CpFsJu7) trek was one of the best treks I've ever been on, It was raining all the time, there were lot's waterfalls and bridges on the way. 
- This is the first time I've experienced Apartments being rented as hotels, they were nice would consider them again specially for longer term stays.
- You can find a good Vada Pav literally anywhere, I've had dozens of them throughout the trip.
- Imagica had the most thrilling rides I've ever been on, It's specially fun with friends.


## What could have been done better?

- Imagica ticket price and vip pass: make sure to buy tickets atleast a day before visit, price are doubled for same day ticket, also get a vip pass to save a lot of time.
