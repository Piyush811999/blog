# Log

## Day-1
* [Dream Land Fun and Adventure](https://maps.app.goo.gl/49FTzZouLnzfqEaH9) Very fun adventure park, with a wide variety of activities to do across various levels of difficulty, some of them were even quite challenging. (8/10)
* **Spice Garden and Ayurvedic Garden**: One of many such spots where you can take a tour of a garden and learn about various spices and Ayurvedic herbs, it was alright mostly the tour is a sales pitch for their products. (6/10)
* [Macofa Chocolate Factory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7C4BTXsv3gQdHgRx5) Didn't try the chocolate at the "chocolate factory" (apologies I am not very bright), had hot chocolate and Belgian hot chocolate though both of them were quite mediocre.
* [Punarjani Traditional Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aMgu3nzCCGhNR4sw8) One of the best performative experiences of my life, the performance and the "vibes" (again apologies for using this word as stated earlier I am not very bright) were on point, It was like being transported into a fictional world. There are two types of performances you can see here, one was kalarippayattu which is Indian martial arts which kept me on my toes, other was classical dance fusion which was one of the most mesmerizing performances I've ever seen. (Spoilers: I did not expect that I would be listening to Heavy Metal at this place) **(10/10)**

## Day-2
* [Kolukkumalai Top View point](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TcL7ufA52xqEkFJU8) The viewpoint itself was pretty good, but the jeep ride along the rocky road leading up to it was a total pain in the ass. (7/10)
* [Mattupetty Dam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Pq3fxvPjfkYWuK9A8) Didn't get to experience much here as there was a long waiting time for boating. Although we found a quiet place to sit nearby and appreciate the view. (6/10)
* [ANACHAL ZIPLINE](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4hAa5wjhisz7sMAP6) Long zip-line with a pretty good view. (P.S. If you weigh less, you might just stop in between, but don't panic! Theyâ€™ll pull you to the endpoint.)
* [Fly High Munnar Hot Air Balloon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MHV5BE2m1o5yeuBA9) Very underwhelming and overpriced. It's a small ascend and descent on a hot air balloon at one place; it was not worth it. (4/10)
* [The Blossom Hydel Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YNkkpsB3gFHR4us37) Very okay public garden, has some photogenic spots. (6/10)

# Food 
Food-wise, we didn't have such a great experience; everything we had there was either average or below average tasting. We ate at the following places:
* [MUNNAR SAMRUDHI RESTAURANT](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X3y9xVhsj36nPVTM6) (Had chicken curry.) Taste was average. 
* [Ottway Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V9nDR8DmzhRAiRv27) Bad.
* Road-roasted corn (which was as expected).
* Had "Kappa Biryani" at a Dhaba which didn't taste good; eventually, we ended up having a plain omelette. 

# Review
Despite me giving low ratings to lots of individual places above, Munnar was well worth the visit. It's a beautiful hill station, and most of the beauty lies in the scenery. Just walking around our hotel area was pleasing in itself. If I ever visit this place again, I would just get a hotel at a scenic location and relax rather than sightseeing all the time. But I would definitely visit [Punarjani Traditional Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aMgu3nzCCGhNR4sw8), and maybe even one of the adventure parks.
