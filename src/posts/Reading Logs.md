# Prologue

At some point in the beginning of this year I decided to set a very ambitious goal for myself, to read 24 books this year, and it’s going as any new year’s goal is canonically supposed to go i.e. not great.
## y tho?

- I like reading and there’s so much I want to read, but I’ve never been able to build a successful habit out of it.
- At the end of the day I read (fiction) for entertainment purposes but I've noticed that brings me much more satisfaction than watching a YouTube video (the platform which I spend most time on currently, *It’s not an addiction, I can quit any time*).
- Sleep is important to me, unfortunately I am bad at it, and so far reading before heading to bed has been the best sleep aid for me.

## Story so far

I’ve finished reading [7 books](https://www.goodreads.com/readingchallenges/gr/annual/2025/QVc1SDY0VVpPR01UNgMjAyNQ), and partially read 3 books (2 fiction (Stoner and Children of Dune) and a non-fiction (Sapiens)).

## What do I need to do to achieve my goal?

Conveniently, as of writing this, there are 17 weeks left in this year and I need to read 17 books. That’s 1 book a week.
<br>

So if
* **p** = number of pages in the book currently reading and
* **n** = number of days I can read in that week,
Then I should be reading **p/n** pages per day.
If I am reading multiple (**k**) books, it should be **(p1/n1)/k** pages for book1, **(p2/n2)/k** pages from book 2 and so on...

<br>

“That’s simple... right?” *I said to myself while shedding a tear*.

<br>

This assumes that I am a perfect being, which I am far from; some days I might read more and some days I might read less (more likely). I don't want to put such constraints on myself. And the main purpose of this thing is that I want to build a new habit that will last a long time, and I want to read books that are already on my shelf and reading list. I don't want to read 24 100-page short stories. <br>

On top of that, some books might not need 7 days to read and some books might take me a whole month. [Cough cough...](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo) <br>

I have to keep in mind that the number of pages from the above calculation is not my true end goal; they are just to provide direction.

## The Plan 

### Weekly

* Plan ahead: pick a book (If not reading anything), see how many days you can read (I won't be reading when I am on vacation).
- At the end of the final day of the week, update this blog.
    - Write the daily logs for the week in the log section.
    - Reflect on the successes and failures, how it went, see if you can learn something from the experience, and update the protocol if needed.
- Write a brief review of the book you read (privately, and mainly for fiction).


### Daily

- Before going to sleep, read for at least 15 mins.
- Write a daily reading log: Read **q** pages from **b** book.
- In case of non-fiction books, take notes alongside reading.
- (Optional) For long books (fiction), it would be wise to write a brief summary every day.
